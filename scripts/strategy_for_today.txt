Strategy for today. You're in swing mode: two to five day holds, no day trading. Trading capital is the pool after gold and copper — about fourteen thousand when flat. Max two positions. In the current bear regime use thirty-five hundred per position and tight stops: one and a half to two and a half percent. Run Swing and Watchlist between 2:45 and 3:15 PM. Pick one or two names that match the four signals: end-of-day ramp, bull flag into the close, sector laggard, or reversal hammer. Avoid earnings and anything the report flags. Enter in the last hour; set your stop; exit next morning between 9:30 and noon. Target one and a half to three percent per trade. Minimum good day when you're in positions: a hundred fifty. Ideal day: seven hundred. You're not forcing it — just keep two positions working when you can and cut losers at the stop.
