# Non–Day-Trading Strategy — $20K, $6K/Mo Target
**ClearBlueSky scanner: swing (2–5 day) + optional trend context. Not day trading.**

---

## 1. Capital & Profit Targets

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **Capital** | $20,000 |
| **Monthly target** | $6,000 (stretch) |
| **Minimum good day** (when in trades) | $150 |
| **Ideal day** (when in trades) | $700 |

**What that implies:**
- $6k/month ≈ $273/day over 22 trading days. We won’t have positions every day, so **on days we’re in trades**, we need average profit well above $273 (e.g. 12–15 “active” days × $400–500 ≈ $6k).
- **$150/day minimum:** One position ($5k) up ~3% = $150. So “minimum good day” = at least one position working for a small win.
- **$700/day ideal:** One position ($5k) up ~14%, or two positions ($5k each) up ~7% each. Treat $700 as a **strong day** when 1–2 positions run; not required every day.

## 2. Portfolio Structure (IBKR)

**Long-term — do not trade (keep):**
- **SGOL** — Gold (physical gold ETF). Hold.
- **FCX** — Copper (Freeport-McMoRan). Hold.

**Trade with the rest:** Cash + any swing positions we put on. Scanner swing trades use only this pool — never sell gold or copper for a swing trade.

**As of Feb 9, 2026:** ~\$20.8k total; SGOL + FCX ≈ \$7k; cash ≈ \$13.8k. So **trading capital** ≈ \$14k (cash available to deploy into 1–2 swing positions).

---

## 3. Position Sizing (trading pool only)

- **Trading pool:** The “rest” after gold + copper (e.g. ~\$14k when 100% cash).
- **Max 2 swing positions at a time.**  
  - **Normal regime:** \$5,000 per position.  
  - **Bear regime:** \$3,500 per position (tighter stops, more cash).
- **Cash reserve:** Keep 20%+ of trading pool in cash; in bear, 50%+.
- **Long-term (SGOL, FCX):** Not part of position sizing; never reduced for swing trades.

So: **\$5k × 2 = \$10k** in play when both slots are filled; in bear, **\$3,500 × 2 = \$7k** in play.

## 4. Strategy: Swing (2–5 day holds), no day trading

**Style:** Use the scanner to find **dips and pullbacks** in names (or sectors) with a trend; hold **2–5 days** for a bounce or continuation; exit on target or stop. No same-day in-and-out.

**Scanners:**
- **Swing (Dips):** Main engine. Emotional dips, RSI, upside to target, earnings warnings.
- **Watchlist:** Your universe; run with Swing to get scored list + AI picks.
- **Trend:** Weekly (or when you want context) for sector/trend bias — only take swing entries in names/sectors that fit the trend.
- **Pre-Market:** Optional context (gaps, sector heat); not for day trading.

**Workflow:**
1. Run **Swing** (+ **Watchlist**) when you’re looking for setups (e.g. once daily, or 2:45–3:15 PM if you like that window).
2. Use report + AI: filter by earnings dates and news; only consider “dip in uptrend” or “emotional selloff” type setups.
3. Enter 1–2 positions; **hold 2–5 days**. Target +2–4% per trade; stop 1.5–2.5% (bear) or up to 3% (better regime).
4. When one position exits, replace with next best setup from a fresh scan so you keep **2 positions working** as often as possible.

**Falling-knife rule:** Do **not** swing into falling knives. If a stock is down sharply over 5–10 days (e.g. **Perf Week &lt; -8%** or **30d change &lt; -10%**) with no clear support or reversal, **skip it** — add to AVOID list. Prefer only **dip-in-uptrend** setups. Reports flag "FALLING KNIFE risk" when 30d or weekly performance is deeply negative.

**Why this fits the tools:** Swing + Watchlist + reports give you dip quality, earnings risk, and trend context. No intraday timing required; multi-day holds match the data and the “not day trading” rule.

## 5. Making $6k/month plausible (math check)

- **Rough need:** ~$6,000 / 22 ≈ $273/day average. Since we’re not in the market every single day, aim for **~12–15 “active” days per month** with an **average ~$400–500 profit** on those days.
- **Per trade:** $5,000 × 3% = $150; $5,000 × 4% = $200. So 2 positions each up 3–4% on a good day = **$300–400**.
- **Implication:** To get there we need (a) **2 positions on most active days**, (b) **win rate high enough** (e.g. 55–65% of trades profitable), (c) **let winners reach +2–4%** and cut losers at 1.5–2.5%. Scanner + AI picks + earnings filter are there to improve (b) and (c).

---

## 6. Daily targets (when you have positions)

| Day type | Goal | How |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Minimum good day** | $150 | At least one position up ~3% ($5k × 3% = $150). |
| **Solid day** | $300–400 | Both positions up ~3–4% combined. |
| **Ideal day** | $700 | One or two positions run 7–14%; rare but possible. |

We’re not forcing $700 every day; we’re **aiming for $150+ on days we’re in trades** and **$700 when we get a strong move**.

---

## 7. Risk (bear regime)

- **Position size:** $3,500 (not $5,000).
- **Stops:** 1.5–2.5%.
- **Cash:** 50%; only 2 positions at a time.
- **Expectation:** Win rate 50–60%; monthly target may land below $6k in bad months. Minimum good day ($150) still the bar when we have positions.

---

## 8. One-page summary

- **Long-term (do not trade):** SGOL (gold), FCX (copper). We trade with the rest.
- **Trading capital:** Cash + swing positions only (~\$14k when flat). Max 2 positions, \$5k each (or \$3.5k in bear).
- **Targets:** $6k/month (stretch), $150/day minimum when in trades, $700/day ideal when in trades.
- **Method:** Swing 2–5 day holds; Swing + Watchlist for entries; Trend for context; no day trading.
- **Per trade:** Target +2–4%; stop 1.5–2.5% (bear) to 3%; use reports for earnings/news filter.
