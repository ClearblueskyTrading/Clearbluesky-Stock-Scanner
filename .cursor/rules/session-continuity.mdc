# Session Continuity Protocol

## At Session End (When Significant Work Was Done)

Write a session log to the shared memory so the next session picks up seamlessly:

```
D:\scanner\velocity_memory\session_logs\session_YYYYMMDD_brief_topic.md
```

Include:
- What was worked on (project, files, features)
- Key decisions made and why
- Current state (what's done, what's pending)
- Any blockers or open questions
- File paths that were modified

## At Session Start (When Resuming Work)

If context seems missing or the user asks to resume something:
1. Query RAG: `python "D:\scanner\velocity_memory\velocity_rag.py" --query "recent session" --filter sessions`
2. Check the conversation summary if available
3. Read recent session logs from `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\session_logs\`

## "Check Your Brain" Protocol

When the user says "check your brain" or similar:
1. Query RAG for recent sessions and current state
2. Read `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\market_context\current_regime.md` if trading-related
3. List recent files in `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\session_logs\`
4. Summarize what you know and what's current
