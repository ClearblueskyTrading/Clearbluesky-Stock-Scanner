# User Preferences

## Communication Style
- Professional, direct, no fluff
- No excessive post-ambles or summaries after delivering work
- Don't ask permission for obvious next steps — just do the work
- When the user says "do it" or "keep going" — execute, don't explain

## Development Style
- Always test changes before declaring done
- Fix errors immediately, don't leave them for the user
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- When making many changes, use a todo list to track progress
- PowerShell is the shell — no `&&` chaining, use `;` or separate commands

## Key Paths
- Scanner app: `D:\scanner\app\` (also mirrored at `D:\cursor\app\`)
- RAG system: `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\`
- Knowledge base: `C:\Users\EricR\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude AI Knowledge\`
- Reports: `D:\scanner\app\reports\`

## Security
- Never commit API keys to git
- API keys live in `C:\Users\EricR\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude AI Knowledge\api keys.txt`
- Never expose keys in code, docs, or commits
