# Shared Knowledge System

You have access to a persistent knowledge database shared with Claude Desktop.
Both systems read/write to the same ChromaDB vector store — anything indexed is available to both.

## How to Query the Shared Brain

Run from terminal when you need historical context, past decisions, or reference material:

```bash
python "D:\scanner\velocity_memory\velocity_rag.py" --query "your search query"
python "D:\scanner\velocity_memory\velocity_rag.py" --query "your query" --filter trades
```

Filter options: `sessions`, `trades`, `regime`, `strategy`, `scans`, `knowledge`

## How to Write to Shared Memory

Write markdown files to these directories. The RAG watcher auto-indexes them:

- `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\session_logs\` — Session summaries, decisions made, context
- `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\trade_journal\` — Trade entries, exits, P/L
- `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\market_context\` — Market regime, sector rotation notes
- `D:\scanner\velocity_memory\strategy_updates\` — Rule changes, parameter tweaks

Naming convention: `topic_YYYYMMDD.md` (e.g., `session_20260209_scanner_refactor.md`)

After writing, run: `python "D:\scanner\velocity_memory\velocity_rag.py"` to index immediately.

## Shared Knowledge Folder

`C:\Users\EricR\OneDrive\Desktop\Claude AI Knowledge\` — Reference books, PDFs, scan reports, CSV data.
Both Claude Desktop and Cursor can read from here. Files placed here get indexed into the RAG.

## When to Use This

- Starting a new session: query for recent context on the current project
- Making architecture decisions: check if past decisions exist on this topic
- User says "check your brain": query RAG for current state, recent sessions, open items
- Completing work: write a session summary so the next session (yours or Claude's) has context
