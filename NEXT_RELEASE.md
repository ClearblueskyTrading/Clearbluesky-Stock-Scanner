# Next release – planned items

Note for the next release:

- **No duplicates in watchlist** – Watchlist (config + UI) should store and display each ticker only once. Dedupe on add, import, and save.
- **No duplicates in reports** – Scan results and report output should contain no duplicate tickers. Dedupe before generating the .md report.
- **Executive summary in report** – The single .md file (v7.90+) includes YAML + body + 3-model AI consensus. AI analysis should include an executive summary (context, backdrop, findings) before trade recommendations.
