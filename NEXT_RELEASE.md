# Next release – planned items

Note for the next release:

- **No duplicates in watchlist** – Watchlist (config + UI) should store and display each ticker only once. Dedupe on add, import, and save.
- **No duplicates in reports** – Scan results and report output should contain no duplicate tickers. Dedupe before generating the report / writing the PDF.
- **Executive summary when all 3 files go to AI** – When using all 3 report files (PDF, JSON, _ai.txt) with an AI, the output should include a nice executive summary of all the info—not just trade recommendations. Explain context, market/sector backdrop, scan rationale, and key findings in plain language, then trades/actions.
